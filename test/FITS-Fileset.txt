HST WFPC II	WFPC II 800 x 800 x 4 primary array data cube containing the 4 CCD images, plus a table extension containing world coordinate parameters. This sample file has been trimmed to 200 x 200 x 4 pixels to save disk space.
HST WFPC II	WFPC II 1600 x 1600 primary array mosaic constructed from the 4 individual CCD chips. (Image has been trimmed to 100 x 100 pixels to save disk space).
HST FOC		FOC (1024 x 1024) primary array image, plus a table extension containing world coordinate parameters.
HST FOS		FOS 2 x 2064 primary array spectrum containing the flux and wavelength arrays, plus a small table extension.
HST HRS		HRS 2000 x 4 primary array spectrum, plus a small table extension.
HST NICMOS	NICMOS null primary array plus 5 image extensions (270 x 263) containing the science, error, data quality, samples, and time images
HST FGS		FGS file with a 89688 x 7 2-dimensional primary array and 1 table extension. The primary array contains a time series of 7 astrometric quantities.
Astro UIT	Astro1 Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (512 x 512) primary array image
IUE LWP		IUE spectrum contained in vector columns of a binary table.
EUVE		EUVE sky image and 2D spectra, contained in multiple image extensions, with associated binary table extensions. The 1st image extension has been rebinned by a factor of 4 to save disk space.
Random Groups	This example file illustrates the Random Groups FITS file format which has the keywords NAXIS1 = 0 and GROUPS = T. This format has been used almost exclusively for applications in radio interferometry and should not be used for applications outside of this field. It is recommended that new applications should use FITS binary tables to store this type of data. This example file comes from the Classic AIPS 'DDT' (Dirty Dozen Test) benchmarking suite.
